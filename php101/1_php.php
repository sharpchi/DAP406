<h1>PHP &amp; HMTL</h1>
<p>You can mix PHP and HTML together.</p>

<p>This is a <?php echo "sentence"; ?> with a php echo.</p>

<p><?php echo 'You can echo <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a>'; ?>.</p>

<p>It can sometimes become unreadable very quickly, so you need to keep it tidy.</p>
